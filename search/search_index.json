When he turned 13, his life was dramatically inspired - almost by accident he got \"Volunteer Jam 3&amp;4\" double LP by Charlie Daniels Band with guests and friends. Also the same year (1985), Mix saw John Denver live in his native city of St. Petersburg. </p> <p>Although he still remained under the influence of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and other rock'n'roll bands, Mix started dreaming about singing country music, which was almost impossible \u2013 nobody played American country music in Soviet Union. Anyway, he was the first in his 6 million population city to start wearing cowboy hats and dressing like Willie Nelson. </p> <p>And times \u2013 they are changing. Soviet Union collapsed, and, little by little, American music started to penetrate on virgin Russian soil. Mix found a group of young musicians who were also crazy about country music and joined them at age 17 to stay faithful to this music ever since.</p> <p>Over the years, Mix Hawk became a legend in country music in ex-USSR performing, hosting radio shows, festivals, and clubs. Even after becoming a Christian minister, he continued to perform occasionally, always gathering a large audience.</p> <p>In 2014, Mix Hawk moved to the United States and in 2020 settled in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he keeps on preaching and singing.</p>"},{"location":"bio/#musical-journey","title":"Musical Journey","text":"<ul> <li>Early Years: Influenced by The Beatles, Rolling Stones, and rock music</li> <li>1985: Life-changing discovery of Charlie Daniels Band and seeing John Denver live</li> <li>Age 17: Joined first country music group in Russia</li> <li>Career: Became legend in ex-USSR country music scene</li> <li>Ministry: Became Christian minister while continuing to perform</li> <li>2014: Moved to United States</li> <li>2020: Settled in Tulsa, Oklahoma</li> </ul>"},{"location":"bio/#current","title":"Current","text":"<p>Mix Hawk continues his dual calling as both a country music performer and Christian minister in Tulsa, Oklahoma, bringing authentic country music to audiences while serving his community through ministry.</p> <p>Back to Home</p>"},{"location":"photos/","title":"Photos","text":"<p>Welcome to Mix Hawk's photo gallery!
